Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. The number of dimensions is the rank of the array; the shape of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.

The Python core library provided Lists. A list is the Python equivalent of an array, but is resizeable and can contain elements of different types.

A common beginner question is what is the real difference here. The answer is performance. Numpy data structures perform better in:

**Size:**
Numpy data structures take up less space.

**Performance:**

They have a need for speed and are faster than lists.

**Functionality:**
SciPy and NumPy have optimized functions such as linear algebra operations built in.
